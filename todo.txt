- NEED UNIT TESTS
- purge ameritrade API key from history of git repository (or just invalidate it and remove from git)
- Change caching for options requests to use mongodb, possibly with TTL index (or maybe we just keep the data forever?)
- [PARTIAL DONE - NEED TO CONSIDER WHICH HOLIDAYS ARE RELEVANT FOR TRADIND] Automatically compute the number of trading
    days between now and option expiration. Take into account holidays.
- Smoothly handle when price simulation is run after hours - changes how the very first timestep is handled. No open
    price - need to compute gap over previous close price
- Need to consider the number of trading hours remaining in the day. This way it doesn't optimize assuming a full day
    change when theres only part of a day left remaining. Currently this will over-estimate the possible spread
    when executed mid-day in the trading day, since the first day is simulated with a full day left of possible
    price swings, but yet there is only a partial day remaining
- [DONE] Need a mechanism to back-test the monte carlo simulation and optimize its hyperparameters (such as amount of
    history to consider)
- See if we can improve price simulation by taking into account regression to mean
- Something still off with investment simulation to determine optimal amount to invest v.s. amount keep in cash
- Split investment simulation into two classes - one which performs a single simulation, and the other which performs
    the montecarlo calculation across all simulations
- Can we take into account volatility trends?
- Can I inject my own subjective bias into the price simulation? E.g. If i have a rough idea on which direction a price
    will move
- [DONE] Analyze different option expirations and compare against each other to determine optimal portfolio
- [DONE] Analyze different options on different securities against each other, to determine optimal portfolio
- [DONE] Portfolio needs to be diversified to different industries, to prevent too much risk on a single industry. Can
    we calculate market correlations or cross correlations?
- [DONE] Need to correctly handle CALL options, particularly around the montecarlo investment simulation
- Can the script automatically spit out commands, like orders I should execute?
- Can we predict if we should sell an option early, at its current price, rather than wait it out to excersize it?
- Calculations need to take into account trading fees
- [DONE] Need a better metric then MSE for back-testing and optimizing the monte-carlo price simulation
- Switch from using the constants.verboseOutput option to a proper logging system
- Need to track historic trades and how they turned out
- Need to optimize performance of the MonteCarloInvestmentSimulation. Perhaps we should have a trained ML
    model based on a bunch of investment simulations, instead of computing it fresh each time? Just need this
     to go faster so the whole script can spit out the option purchase suggestions more automatically
- Need to move to a better source of data (no more ameritrade). Instead of hardcoded list of symbols, we should choose
    which symbols to trade based on data provided from a financial data provider, using a principled filter & select formula
- Need to check if historic data we are using is normalized against stock splits
- Test whether montecarlo should be doing the gap and day changes separately, or if they should be merged together
- Need a optimization statistic that I can compare between different executions, rather than just on the same execution
- Simulate the entirety of the portfolio of options, rather than just a single option
- [MAYBE] Don't trade symbols that have moved heavily during the day
- Need to consider that options dont trade in decimals, and must usually be some sort of round number (like in 5 cent increments)
- [MAYBE] Don't trade stocks that have already had big price movements in recent history (e.g. if they already fell a
    lot in last 6 months)
- [MAYBE] Compute option trades at market rather then limit orders in the center of a movement
- Test whether we should replace the price simulations based on just using exact historical price changes,
    to using a precomputed random distribution. The distribution shouldn't be the normal - should consider
    skew and kurtosis. Should closely match the price change distribution
- Test whether there should be a bias towards using more recent price changes in the monte-carlo price simulation.
    E.g. make the more recent price changes more likely to be selected then ones in the more distant past.
- [MAYBE] Implement code to automatically execute trades once they've been decided
- [MAYBE] include an automatic warning to not to trade the open or mid-day. Only trade the close.
- [MAYBE] compare optimization hyperparameters based on symbol, asset class, sector, etc...
- [MAYBE] separate the realtime price quotes from the historic data. This way we don't rely on this hack of using the
    "close" price on the current day, which is actually just the current best price when the day hasn't actually closed
    yet. Should be more a more principled approach.
- [MAYBE] automatically liquidate the options when they are near their expiration
