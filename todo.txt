- purge ameritrade API key from history of git repository (or just invalidate it and remove from git)
- Change caching for options requests to use mongodb, possibly with TTL index (or maybe we just keep the data forever?)
- Automatically compute the number of trading days between now and option expiration. Take into account holidays.
- Smoothly handle when price simulation is run after hours - changes how the very first timestep is handled. No open price - need to compute gap over previous close price
- Need a mechanism to back-test the monte carlo simulation and optimize its hyperparameters (such as amount of history to consider)
- See if we can improve price simulation by taking into account regression to mean
- Something still off with investment simulation to determine optimal amount to invest v.s. amount keep in cash
- Split investment simulation into two classes - one which performs a single simulation, and the other which performs the montecarlo calculation across all simulations
- Can we take into account volatility trends?
- Can I inject my own subjective bias into the price simulation? E.g. If i have a rough idea on which direction a price will move
- Analyze different option expirations and compare against each other to determine optimal portfolio
- Analyze different options on different securities against each other, to determine optimal portfolio
- Portfolio needs to be diversified to different industries, to prevent too much risk on a single industry. Can we calculate market correlations or cross correlations?
- Need to correctly handle CALL options, particularly around the montecarlo investment simulation
- Can the script automatically spit out commands, like orders I should execute?
- Can we predict if we should sell an option early, at its current price, rather then wait it out to excersize it?
- Calculations need to take into account trading fees

- do I make this public?
